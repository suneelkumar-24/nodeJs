Node js is not a lanugage
this is a server environment
node js can be connect with database but not js
js runs in browser , node runs on serve that's why we can connect with it database
node js use chromes v8 engine to exectue the code
node js mostly used for APIs

filter function always works on array to find a specific value

Modules type
1. external Modules
2. core modules = modules that are pre-written in language (code process , db connect , api call like console.log,fs,buffer,http)
    2.1 - global modules -> don't require to import
    2.2 - non global modules -> need to import like fs

http module : handle request and response of server

pakage.json file : keeps project details related to code like project version , name , repository , different packages,

node js is single threaded
node js async

to get input from console use console.log(process.argv)
first two parameter (node_installation_dir ,__filename) and other parameter we can pass
only the content of folder is accessible in node out of that folder you can't access any files

buffer is like RAM a temporary memory that is required by node js to perfrom operation


drawback of asynchronouc
let a =10; let b=0;

setTimeout(()=>{
    b=20;

},2000) //2-seconds

console.log(a+b); result will be 10;

solution: callback or use promises , previously we use callback now we use promises,async wait

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
node js architecture

Event Loop : =>
call stack (is always necessary) -> node APIs -> call back queue

call stack register all the function before the execution of the function

node APIs : external functions register there which are out of JS like timeout function
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


static function load static page or content

template engine: use to create dynamic pages


for the common layout use include command with dash - insted of = in <%-%>

middleware 

nodemon || time saving module: runs continously no need to run again and again


Moduels : OS, FS, events, http, manual,
every defined function belongs to Gloabl but not variables and functions
